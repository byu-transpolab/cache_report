# Background

Logan, Utah, situated in northern Cache County with a population of approximately 55,000 residents, is home to the main campus of Utah State University (USU) with an enrollment of about 18,000 students.
The city is served by the Cache Valley Transit District (CVTD), a local transit system that operates with zero fares funded by sales tax.
With 20 distinct routes, CVTD provides convenient travel for Logan residents, connecting them to various parts of the city and county.

CVTD operates the Loop, a route spanning from USU to Main Street, creating a continuous loop.
Due to its relative distance from major metropolitan areas, Logan experiences minimal cross traffic, with the majority of traffic being internal.
The unique location and characteristics of Logan make it an ideal candidate for modeling travel behavior using an activity-based travel model.

For this project, we will implement an activity-based travel model for Logan, Utah.
An activity-based travel model is a method used to understand and predict travel patterns of individuals based on their activities throughout the day.
Unlike the traditional 4-step model that focus solely on trips between origins and destinations, activity-based models consider the full range of activities people engage in and the associated travel.
In an activity-based travel model, individuals participate in various activities such as work, shopping, recreation, or education.
The model takes into account the scheduling and sequences of these events, as well as the travel choices make by the individuals to fulfill their activity needs.

# Model Design

We will create an implementation of ActivitySim to model travel demand in the study area.
Our ActivitySim implementation will be based on the existing SEMCOG model, in part due to its inclusion of remote work submodels.
However, ActivitySim does not assign network traffic, so we will use AequilibraE for this step.
We will need the highway network, transit network, and bike network.
If there is not an existing bike network, then we will add one to the model using Google Earth to identify and map the existing network.

We will also use PopulationSim to create a synthetic population for the area.
Our synthetic population will largely be based on an existing PopulationSim implementation for Cedar City, UT, tailored for Logan.
Most of the PopulationSim controls will come from the Census, though the TAZ-level data will come from an existing travel demand model for Logan.
Number of households is the only TAZ-level control we will use, however, due to its importance in modeling trip generation.

The SEMCOG model contains the following model steps:

-   initialize_landuse
-   initialize_households
-   compute_accessibility
-   work_from_home
-   add_size_tables
-   school_location
-   workplace_location
-   transit_pass_subsidy
-   transit_pass_ownership
-   auto_ownership_simulate
-   free_parking
-   telecommute_frequency
-   cdap_simulate
-   mandatory_tour_frequency
-   mandatory_tour_scheduling
-   joint_tour_frequency
-   joint_tour_composition
-   joint_tour_participation
-   joint_tour_destination
-   joint_tour_scheduling
-   non_mandatory_tour_frequency
-   non_mandatory_tour_destination
-   non_mandatory_tour_scheduling
-   tour_mode_choice_simulate
-   atwork_subtour_frequency
-   atwork_subtour_destination
-   atwork_subtour_scheduling
-   atwork_subtour_mode_choice
-   stop_frequency
-   trip_purpose
-   trip_destination
-   trip_purpose_and_destination
-   trip_scheduling
-   trip_mode_choice
-   write_data_dictionary
-   track_skim_usage
-   write_tables
-   write_trip_matrices

Nearly all of these submodels can be estimated using data from the Utah Household Travel Survey.
However, the free parking model will be fixed at the TAZ level to charge for parking only at USU campus.
Additionally, the transit system is fully funded by sales tax, and so we will not estimate transit pass ownership or subsidies, as transit is free for everyone.
Our model will have the same pipeline as above with these exceptions.

# Project Schedule

The following is a rough schedule for the project:

Report 1 (Feb 5):

-   Network assignment (AequilibraE)
-   Accessibility (network skims)
-   Work from home / telecommute frequency
-   Vehicle ownership

Report 2 (March 1):

-   School/work location
-   Daily activity pattern
-   All mandatory, non-mandatory, and joint tour models including mode choice

Report 3 (Apr 1):

-   All at-work subtour models
-   Intermediate stop frequency
-   All trip models
