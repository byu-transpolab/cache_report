Overall design memo

# Notes so far

-   Use Aequilibre for network (use the open standard)
-   Probably use SEMCOG to base the model on, due to WFH implementation
-   Asim steps to include:
    -   Essential/behind-the-scenes
        -   Init
        -   Access
        -   shadow price?
        -   cdap
        -   write tables etc
    -   Models
        -   WFH
        -   school location
        -   work location
        -   ~~transit pass~~ (assumed)
        -   auto ownership
        -   ~~vehicle type~~ (assumed)
        -   Telecommute freq
        -   ~~free parking~~
        -   tour freq/scheduling
        -   vehicle allocation
        -   tour mode choice
        -   atwork
        -   intermediate stop(s)
        -   trip freq/sched (decide on probability vs logit) (likely prob, as logit is part of another model)
        -   trip mode
        -   ~~parking location~~

Make a note/list of where we will get the data to estimate these coefficients from.
We will have the HH travel survey, note if we need data from anywhere else.

Make sure to get all this data:

-   Highway network
-   Transit network
-   Bike network (w/topography?)
-   SE data by TAZ
-   TAZ geojson

All this goes in the data repo

Also synth pop from ACS PUMS?
