Overall design memo

# Notes so far

Logan, Utah, situated in northern Cache County with a population of approximately 55,000 residents, is home to the main campus of Utah State University (USU) with an enrollment of about 18,000 students.
The city is served by the Cache Valley Transit District (CVTD), a local transit system that operates with zero fares funded by sales tax.
With 20 distinct routes, CVTD provides convenient travel for Logan residents, connecting them to various parts of the city and county.

CVTD operates the Loop, a route spanning from USU to Main Street, creating a continuous loop.
Notably, the Green Line buses follow a clockwise direction, while the Blue Line buses travel counter-clockwise.
Due to its relative distance from major metropolitan areas, Logan experiences minimal cross traffic, with the majority of traffic being internal.
The unique location and characteristics of Logan make it an ideal candidate for modeling travel behavior using an activity-based travel model.

For this project, we will implement an activity-based travel model for Logan, Utah.
An activity-based travel model is a method used to understand and predict travel patterns of individuals based on their activities throughout the day.
Unlike the traditional 4-step model that focus solely on trips between origins and destinations, activity-based models consider the full range of activities people engage in and the associated travel.
In an activity-based travel model, individuals participate in various activities such as work, shopping, recreation, or education.
The model takes into account the scheduling and sequences of these events, as well as the travel choices make by the individuals to fulfill their activity needs.
To implement the activity-based travel model, we will use AequilibraE for the network and assignment, \[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\] to create a synthetic population, and ActivitySim for modeling the various steps of the model.

We will use AequilibraE for the network and assignment.
We will need the highway network, transit network, and bike network.
If there is not an existing bike network, then we will add one to the model using Google Earth to identify and map the existing network.

To create the synthetic population, we will ....

We will use ActivitySim to create the model itself.
We will using the SEMCOG base model (based on Detroit, Michigan) because it has a work from home (WFH) model included.
There are many models to include and we will be able to calibrate them and estimate the appropriate coefficients for each using the Utah Household Travel Survey.
We will divide the models calibration into groups to serve as a schedule for the semester.

For Report 1 (due Feb 5th) we plan to complete: Network Assignment, Accessibility (skims), Work From Home (WFH), Auto Ownership, and Telecommute Frequency.

For Report 2 (due March 1st) we plan to complete: School Location, Work Location, Coordinated Daily Activity Pattern (CDAP), Mandatory Tour Frequency/Scheduling, Non-Mandatory Tour Frequency/Destination Choice/Scheduling, and Tour Mode Choice.

For Report 3 (due April 1st) we plan to complete: School Escorting, Joint Tour Frequency/Composition/Participation/Destination Choice/Scheduling, At Work Subtours Frequency/Destination Choice/Scheduling/Mode, Intermediate Stop Frequency, and Trip Scheudling (probabilistic).

-   Use Aequilibre for network (use the open standard)
-   Probably use SEMCOG to base the model on, due to WFH implementation
-   Asim steps to include:
    -   Essential/behind-the-scenes
        -   Init
        -   Access
        -   shadow price?
        -   cdap
        -   write tables etc
    -   Models
        -   WFH
        -   school location
        -   work location
        -   ~~transit pass~~ (assumed)
        -   auto ownership
        -   ~~vehicle type~~ (assumed)
        -   Telecommute freq
        -   ~~free parking~~
        -   tour freq/scheduling
        -   vehicle allocation
        -   tour mode choice
        -   atwork
        -   intermediate stop(s)
        -   trip freq/sched (decide on probability vs logit) (likely prob, as logit is part of another model)
        -   trip mode
        -   ~~parking location~~

Make a note/list of where we will get the data to estimate these coefficients from.
We will have the HH travel survey, note if we need data from anywhere else.

Make sure to get all this data:

-   Highway network
-   Transit network
-   Bike network (w/topography?)
-   SE data by TAZ
-   TAZ geojson

All this goes in the data repo

Also synth pop from ACS PUMS?
